                                       Supply Chain Traceability & Inventory Management System

Problem: A food or retail company needs to track products from their origin (farm or factory) to the final customer to ensure quality and address recalls quickly. 
Current systems lack a unified view of the entire supply chain. 

Salesforce Solution: Create a system that provides end-to-end visibility of a product's journey.


Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

Requirement Gathering: The core needs are to track products, manage inventory, and provide a quick way to trace a product's history. The system must be able to handle a high volume of data and provide a unified view for both inventory managers and quality assurance teams.

Business Process Mapping: The process begins with a product being assigned to a Lot at the factory. The lot is then included in a Shipment to a Retail Location. At the store, the product is sold to a customer. The system needs to track each step and link the data, allowing for backward and forward traceability.

Industry-specific Use Case Analysis: A key use case is a product recall. If a product is found to be defective, the company needs to quickly identify which specific lots and shipments were affected, and which retail locations received them. This project will demonstrate the ability to handle this critical scenario efficiently.
